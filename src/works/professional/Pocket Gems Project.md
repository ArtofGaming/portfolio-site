### What I Learned

Working in a studio setting has been enlightening and has shown me a side of the industry I hadn't gotten to see before. I learned more about not only coding but also about being a good team member. I gained more pride in my work as it was no longer just something given out to a hypothetical audience, but something meant to be served to an existing playerbase and I not only had to uphold the standards of a brand but also highlight my teammates amazing work and establish myself. It was the first time I had to make commits on such a large repo and it helped me learn more about how to best use version control in a large company environment as opposed to a small team repo or a personal repo.
